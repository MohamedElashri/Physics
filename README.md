Some physics analysis and tools I'm using/used in my life

1-  [GR package](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/GR.nb)

This is a simple Mathematica package for GR standard calculations. it starts with calculating Christoffels then calculates Ricci tensor components then Ricci scalar and in the end, gives einstein's tensor. 
it has already example with FRW metric you can run it.

2-  [phase portait plotter](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/phase%20portait.m)

given potnetial function, this package plot the potntial and phase portait. 

3-  [1-D Ising Model](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Ising%20model.ipynb)

Jupyter Notebook for 1-D Ising Model simulation
