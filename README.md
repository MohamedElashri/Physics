Some physics analysis and tools I'm using/used in my life

1.  [GR package](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/GR.nb) (Mathematica)

This is a simple Mathematica package for GR standard calculations. it starts with calculating Christoffels then calculates Ricci tensor components then Ricci scalar and at the end gives einstein's tensor. 
it has already example with FRW metric you can run it.

2.  [phase portait plotter](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/phase%20portait.m) (Matlab)

Given a potnetial function, this package plot the potntial and phase portait. 

3.  [1-D Ising Model](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Ising%20model.ipynb) (Python)

Jupyter Notebook for 1-D Ising Model simulation


4. [IBM Quantum Computer Exercise](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/IBM%20Quantum%20Computer%20exercise.ipynb) (Python)

Using IBM open source SDK for using their IBM Q QC. available online for free at [IBM Computing Center](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)

5. [Line Integral along a Path](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Line%20Integral.nb) (Mathematica)

The code below is designed to computer a line integral along a path, defined by r(t)=<x(t),y(t)>, through a vector field, accumulating the dot products of the tangent vectors with the field vectors along the path When the vector field represents a force field, 

6. [Applying master equation to model COVID-19 spread problem](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/SIR%20Model.nb) (Mathematica)

Using master equation to develop SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 among population. 

7. [Anisotripic Universe Evolution Simulation  ](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/GR.py) (Python)

Numerical evolution of a Bianchi  universe with anisotripic stress energy with trivial initial conditions.

8. [2d-Ising Monte-Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/2d_ising.py) (Python)

Monte-Carlo simulation of 2D ising model without magnetic field. with plots to important physical parameters (Energy, Mangtization and Specific heat)
