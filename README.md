| Project                                                      | Description                                                  | Language    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| [GR package](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/General%20Relativity/GR.nb) | This is a simple Mathematica package for GR standard calculations. it starts with calculating Christoffels then calculates Ricci tensor components then Ricci scalar and at the end gives einstein's tensor. <br/>it has already example with FRW metric you can run it. | Mathematica |
| [Applying master equation to model COVID-19 spread problem](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Statistical%20Mechanics/SIR%20Model.nb) | Using master equation to develop SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 among population. | Mathematica |
| [Quantum Perturbation Theory](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Misc/Perturbation.nb) | This code calculates the first and second order time independent quantum perturbation for perturbed hamiltonians in matrix form due to small perturbation. | Mathematica |
| [Line Integral along a Path](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Misc/Line%20Integral.nb) | The code below is designed to computer a line integral along a path, defined by r(t)=<x(t),y(t)>, through a vector field, accumulating the dot products of the tangent vectors with the field vectors along the path When the vector field represents a force field, | Mathematica |
| [1-D Ising Model](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Statistical%20Mechanics/Ising/Python/1d/Ising%20model.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for 1-D Ising Model simulation              | Python      |
| [IBM Quantum Computer Exercise](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Quantum%20Computing/IBM%20Quantum%20Computer%20exercise.ipynb) | Using IBM open source SDK for using their IBM Q QC. available online for free at [IBM Computing Center](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) | Python      |
| [Anisotripic Universe Evolution Simulation  ](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/General%20Relativity/Cosmology/GR.py) | Numerical evolution of a Bianchi  universe with anisotripic stress energy with trivial initial conditions. | Python      |
| [2d-Ising Monte-Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Statistical%20Mechanics/Ising/Python/2d/IsingModel.py) | Monte-Carlo simulation of 2D ising model without magnetic field. with plots to important physical parameters (Energy, Mangtization and Specific heat) | Python      |
| [Phase portait plotter](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Physics/blob/master/Misc/phase%20portait.m) | Given a potnetial function, this package plot the potntial and phase portait. | Matlab      |
